# How to prefix a PrestaShop module

**Hello PrestaShop Products** module for PrestaShop. A module to showcase the PHP-Prefixer service.

It’s super quick to get a [PHP-Prefixer](https://php-prefixer.com/) project up and running. Install any library freely. PHP-Prefixer will manage your namespaces.

- **Use the same libraries across all platforms**: Develop your solutions using the same libraries for all the platforms you work in, specifically WordPress, Joomla, PrestaShop, Drupal, Laravel, Symfony, Slim Framework, etc.
- **Composer + PrestaShop**: Use Composer for your PrestaShop projects. PHP-Prefixer will process the dependencies to run smoothly along with other third-party plug-ins.
- **Fully integrated with Git**: Declare your name space configuration and let the service produce the packages. No local installation. No Phars. No new dependencies.
